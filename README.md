# Character Sheet Parts

This is a testing ground for the separate parts for the web character sheet I am designing. The end goal is to be able to put these pieces together, along with a backend to handle data, to create a full-on character sheet.

Google Jam Board of the things I want to add in:

This will be primarily used for seeing if I can combine multiple parts into a cohesive structure, which I can then add into the final product.
